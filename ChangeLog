2010-06-28	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.4.0

	* JSON support added for viewing events, content, and state information. The extra
	  parameter should be added to the querying servlets in the form of "format=[FORMAT]" 
	  and for now supports "xml" and "json". No "format" parameter would be interpreted by
	  the broker as the default format which is "xml".
	  
	* Caching now supports threading for automatic storage and retrieval
	
	* Auto-start and auto-install scripts are added to the code for those who would like to
	  generate it from all the existing bundles. existing OSGiBroker bundles should still be
	  added manually but all the other libraries are installed automatically.
	  
	* The parameter "queryBase" can be used to determine whether the query should operate 
	  based on the server time or the client time. queryBase equal to null or equal to 
	  "server" would consider servertime for querying, while queryBase equal to client 
	  considers client time for querying events
	 
	* An event attribute with the name timestamp is now considered as a reserved
	  attribute to be used by the client to timestamp the client time for the
	  event. This time stamp can be used to retrieve queries based on client timestamp
	  from the events provided by the clients. The value of timestamp should be
	  defined in milliseconds and is stored in the column `client_time` under eventlogs 
	  table.
	  
	* event queries can be done based on client and server time. and using the following
	  attributes as parameters passed to the osgibroker/topic servlet (All the times
	  should be provided in milliseconds and an absolute time should be in the form of the
	  EPOCH time):
		
		** start - the absolute starting or end time of the request, depending on the use of the 'beforeX' or 'afterX' parameter. If omitted means "now".
    	** beforeT - the relative starting time (i.e. before the start time)
    	** beforeE - the relative number of events (i.e. before the start time)
    	** afterT - the relative end time of the request for events
    	** afterE - the relative end time of the request for events
    	** end - the absolute end time of the request
    	** The parameters for frame-based query come in the following order.
    		*** non existence of the start parameter means NOW!
    		*** the priority for responding to the requests is as follows:
    			end > befreE > afterE > beforeT > afterT
    			That is, if more than one of the above parameters exist in the request,
    			the one with the higher priority is considered as the intention for the
    			query and is responded by the servlet.    	
    	** The use of the `querySize` parameter is deprecated as it can be modeled using
    	   a `beforeE` parameter and the number of events to be retrieved without a `start`
    	   time

	* Database name now can be properly set from the configuration file and any arbitrary name can be selected.
	
	* Uploading content is modified and is now working properly. 
		** The upload form can be accessed under HOST:PORT/html/upload.html
		** The content then can be accessed under HOST:PORT/content/[contentid]
	
	* The cache threading and storing issue is fixed so the timing is properly configurable through the configuration file
	
	* The name for the host is fixed, so the network interface can be used in order to associate the 
	  interface name to it with the default on set to "eth0"
	
	* The publisher and the subscribers where implemented single threaded as a result a hanging 
	  subscriber or a delayed client would delay the delivery of messages to all other clients.
	  The new release creates a CachedThreadPool for the clients requesting access to the delivery
	  of messages so the message delivery no longer gets hung up by the clients and the delivery
	  for different clients is served independent of the others.     	  

2010-03-22	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.3.2
	* Default Password for the DB is changed
	* UnsubscribeAll functionality added. This allows one client to unsubscribe from
	  all topics it is registered to. This is done by not specifying the name of the 
	  topic that the client would like to usubscribe from. If the topic is NULL, the 
	  client will be unsubscribed from all topics (Care should be given in using this
	  functionality).
	
	* The Queue full issue fixed. The queue size for the received messages by a polling
	  client was set to be 1000. A client, idle for a long time, would render the queue
	  full. Now upon a queue full situation, the oldest message in the queue would be 
	  replaced by a new one. The new queue size is 500.
	
	* The problem with running out of heap memory is solved. The problem was due to having
	  lots of result sets unclosed when querying the database. The issue was fixed by 
	  carefully closing all of them. DBCP supports a way to close the result sets and connections
	  and garbage collecting them automatically. This will be added in the later releases.

2010-02-03	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.3.1
	* The clients can query content elements or state elements of a topic
	  individually and by specifying the ID for the respective content or 
	  state without having to poll for the entire state or content of a 
	  topic. Same works for deleting the elements of content or state.
	
	* NotificationTopics are added
		** For each topic, "topicname", that a client registers to, the broker 
		   automatically creates a notification topic with the following format: 
		   "topicname__notification__".
		   
		** No client is allowed to subscribe to a NotificationTopic or post events
		   to the NotificationTopic. All messages published to a NotificationTopic
		   and all the clients subscribed under a NotificationTopic are internally 
		   handled by the Broker. The clients can only poll the NotificationTopics
		   with notifications mainly on subscription/unsubscription events and 
		   changes to the content or state of a topic.
		   
		** The Broker sends notifications to the NotificationTopic associated with 
		    each topic, indicating changes (e.g., add, delete, update) to the content
			of a topic or to the state attributes of a topic.
		   
	* Expiration for client subscriptions is added to the broker. 	
		** During subscription to the /osgibroker/subscribe servlet, each client can 
		   specify an "expires" parameter with its value specifying the number of seconds
		   before the client subscription expires. If no "expires" parameter is defined,
		   the broker assumes that the registration for the client will never expire.
		
		** A new servlet named /osgibroker/keepAlive is added to the Broker. the 
		   /osgibroker/keepAlive server is used to renew subscription of a client 
		   with the broker. This servlet requires "clientID" and "topic" as its 
		   mandatory parameters specifying the ID for the client and the topic
		   for which the subscription will be renewed. The servlet also accepts
		   an "expires" parameter, indicating the new number of seconds that the
		   client will remain subscribed with the broker after the latest call to 
		   the /osgibroker/keepAlive servlet. A client that is initially subscribed
		   as a permanent client (i.e., without an "expires" parameter during its
		   subscription), can be changed to a temporary client by calling the
		   /osgibroker/keepAlive function for this client under the specified topic
		   and with an "expires" parameter and value defined for it. It is important
		   to note that, once a client becomes a temporary client, i.e., if the server
		   tracks its expiration, it is no longer possible to make the client a 
		   permanent client and from there on, the subscription of the client should
		   be controled by the responsible client.
		   
		** In the /osgibroker/keepAlive servlet, in case a client is not subscribed
		   with the specified topic, or the client has already expired once the 
		   /osgibroker/keepAlive servlet is called, the broker returns an error
		   response 417 (SC_EXPECTATION_FAILUE), with the following error message:
		   "No Client with this ClientID is alive".
		   
		** NOTE: It is important to mention that subscription expiratioins happen on
		         a per topic basis. That is, the client can define an expiration for 
				 every topic that it registers to. If an expiration is defined for a
				 topic, it is the role of the client to make sure that renewals happen,
				 if necessary. The Broker will automatically unsubscribe the client
				 from a topic and its NotificationTopic upon expiration of its registration
				 time.

2009-11-19	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.2.9
	* Port Scanning for the Modem is done automatically. The Gateway gets plugged in,
	and as soon as the installer gets turned on, the port scanner starts looking for
	the modem gateway. If the modem gateway is detected, the modem gets hooked to the
	broker and the broker start using SMS as a publisher.
	
	* The SMS Installer is a lot more stable now. It automatically checks into the list
	of bundles in the bundle context and detects which of the required functions for
	running SMS is already installed. It installs the ones that need to be installed and
	updates those that should be updated, and finally, starts those that need to starts.
	Things happen a lot more smoother for a user.
	
	* At the time of scanning ports, a progress bar is added to show what ports are being
	scanned and how many more ports are remained to be scanned.

2009-10-14	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.2.8
	* A SMSInstaller bundle is added to the system that enables platform 
	specific installation of the SMS module and the required libraries. 
	
	* There is configuration file for the SMS module located in "configurations/services/" 
	that can be switched ON or OFF. If the switch is ON, the SMS modules and libraries will 
	be installed, if it is OFF, the module and the libraries will be uninstalled.

2009-10-7	Nima Kaviani	<nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.2.8
	* The connection timeout issue for DBCP is solved. The connections no
	longer get expired because of sitting idle in the pool for so long.
	
	* The synchronization issue with multiple objects trying to access the
	broker is solved. Using DBCP, each client is assigned its own
	Connection object to connect to the DB and thus there is no need to
	synchronize the connections.
	
	* The serial port for the SMS module can be configured using the
	properties file in the broker. The file is called
	"ca.ubc.magic.broker.publisher.service.sms.SMSPublisherDS.properties"
	
	* The configuration file for DBCP now can be configured to define the
	parameters for DBCP connection eviction and eviction idle time in the
	"ca.ubc.magic.osgibroker.storage.mysql.properties".

	* The broker now comes with the WebConsole module, enabling
	configuration of the broker to happen using the WebConsole without
	having to deal with the command line. The WebConsole is accessible
	from http://<your-host-name>:8800/system/console

2009-09-20	Nima Kaviani <nimak@ece.ubc.ca> v.1.2.7
	* DBCP is now used for checking the connections
